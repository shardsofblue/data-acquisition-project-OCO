# Memo 4 — Data Acquisition Project

## Assignment requirements

_This memo is produced in response to the requirements of the [Data Acquisition Project](https://github.com/smussenden/intro-to-data-journalism-public/blob/master/sessions/03/03-Homework-Assigned/B-data-acquisition-project.md) in the Fall 2018 Computer Assisted Reporting Course at the University of Maryland._

* About the database: Describe the database you sought, how and why it is maintained by the agency, how it has been used in other reporting (if you know), and why it would be of value to a reporter.

* About the law: How did you determine that these are public records? Were they of the sort that contained both public and nonpublic information?

* About the negotiation: Tell us about your contacts with the agency. Did officials put up barriers to access or accommodate you? Did they object to releasing the data in electronic form? What was the outcome?

* Looking ahead: If you have not obtained the data, what steps would you or someone else need to take to perfect the request?

* Lessons learned: What did you learn from this project that you might be able to apply to future reporting efforts and that would be useful for other students to know? Did you learn anything about yourself? Your insights here are an important feature of the assignment.

## Overview

I have been trying to acquire two databases from the Office of Cemetery Oversight. The OCO handles registration of and complaints against cemeteries, crematories, monument dealers and providers of burial goods and services — a collection of businesses known as the "death care" industry. 

The OCO regulates only for-profit organizations. The OCO does not have formal jurisdiction over religious, nonprofit or family cemeteries, nor those owned by counties, cities or municipalities, but nevertheless accepts and mediates complaints against those organizations, as well. In one of the letters the agency generated in response to my PIA, it said it regulates only "about 115" out of "more than 5,000" estimated to be "operating or formerly operating" in the state.

## Databases

The databases I have been trying to get are **_1.) the database holding all complaints_** and **_2.) the database holding all registrant information_**, for cross-referencing purposes. While the complaints are technically stored in a spreadsheet, I will refer to both files as "databases" throughout this memo for simplicity's sake.

The complaints from fiscal years 2013 through 2017 are stored in an Excel spreadsheet, entered by hand from submitted paper forms that consumers must mail to the OCO. 

The registrant information is stored in an IBM Db2 database. Both are maintained by the agency for bookkeeping purposes. OCO employees access the complaints spreadsheet directly but must work through the organization's IT department to generate reports from the registrant database.

## Discovery

I found the OCO on the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation website. Following the link to the OCO-specific website, I could see there are a number of forms to fill out for licensing, registration and filing a complaint. The registrant information is searchable using a web form on the website, indicating it is stored in a database format. A phone call confirmed that the complaints are stored in an Excel file. 

These databases are public information because they are collected by the state for oversight purposes. However, the OCO director says some information in both databases must be redacted to protect the privacy of individuals, citing §4-333 of the [MPIA law](http://www.marylandattorneygeneral.gov/OpenGov%20Documents/PIA_manual_printable.pdf), which provides only for the disclosure of specific information relating to licensing:

1. the name of the licensee;
2. the business address of the licensee or, if the business address is not available, the home address of the licensee after the custodian redacts any information that identifies the location as the home address of an individual with a disability as defined in § 20-701 of the State Government Article;
3. the business telephone number of the licensee;
Maryland Public Information Act Manual (14th ed., October 2015) Appendix E-41
4. the educational and occupational background of the licensee;
5. the professional qualifications of the licensee;
6. any orders and findings that result from formal disciplinary actions; and
7. any evidence that has been provided to the custodian to meet the requirements of a statute as to financial responsibility.

Any other information that may be stored by the agency is only subject to disclosure at the discretion of the organization provided there is a "compelling public purpose" and doing so does not break any rules or regulations of the particular office.

## Industry in context

Previous stories that have been written about the death care industry center mainly on complaints filed with the OCO. 

A March 2016 [article from News-4 Washington](https://www.nbcwashington.com/investigations/Complaints-About-Damage-Contracts-Rising-at-Maryland-Cemeteries-372032102.html) focuses on a 40 percent increase in complaints from 2014 to 2015. The article opens with an anecdote but seems to have been sparked by an analysis of the complaints files. Here is a similar article from [Connecticut](https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/investigations/Neglected-Cemeteries-Whos-Responsible--490730341.html).

Other stories about the industry tend to be sparked by specific incidents, such as this [Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/2000/10/12/cemetery-grave-digging-probed/9debc293-9ad5-45f6-bb8a-a8e00122e73b/?utm_term=.0cff692b3da7) from October 2000 covering potential illegal behavior by a cemetery. A cemetery watchdog group found a pile of soil and human remains near the cemetery, allegedly exhumed to make room for more burials. The article mentions the OCO as the oversight body and quotes several government officials, but does not make use of specific documentation or the kinds of numeric analysis that come from a database. ABC30-40 wrote a similar article in [Alabama](https://abc3340.com/news/local/2-years-later).

Other articles about the industry are often narrowly-focused — usually on specific complaints such as [this one](https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/nation/military/investigation-launched-at-maryland-veterans-cemetery/65-512665035) — highlight commemorative activities for Memorial Day or similar events, or focus on historically significant graves or cemeteries — their locations, conditions or significance to current development projects. 

There has also been news recently about historically black cemeteries in Maryland being [moved](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/hiding-real-black-history-lawsuit-fights-plan-to-move-historic-cemetery-at-mgm-casinos-doorstep/2017/04/03/18cbbf5e-10b4-11e7-8fed-dbb23e393b15_story.html?utm_term=.cf1c7397b9a9) (April 2017) or [developed over](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/a-battlefield-of-memory-asphalt-where-a-black-cemetery-is-said-to-have-stood/2017/02/23/af01ba42-efa2-11e6-9973-c5efb7ccfb0d_story.html?utm_term=.7ba892bed002) (Feb. 2017 and [here](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-laurel-cemetery-excavation-20180313-story.html), March 2018), an issue which deserves further research. ProPublica has an interesting article from June about such cemeteries in Illinois being [abandoned or deliberately destroyed](https://www.propublica.org/article/abandoned-african-american-cemeteries-illinois-jerrel-floyd).

Other recent stories about the industry, again not making use of databases:

* [Prepaid cemetery plot with someone else buried in it](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Virginia-Couple-Says-Someone-Is-Buried-in-Their-Cemetery-Plot-451940993.html), _Oct. 20, 2017 News-4 Washington_

## Contacts

_My complete contact log  is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wJiyLqUx2i2YtEJE7F97OT7KUX-YosbKdVR2489Z2Lc/view)._

My initial contacts with the director of the Office of Cemetery Oversight were positive. She told me a great deal about her organization and its role in the death care industry and helped me understand the kind and types of records it keeps. She was and continued to be responsive to emails and phone calls throughout the process. 

The director responded to my initial fact-finding email with a formal [MPIA response letter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13maNAB5elobKtn7zEVh0d4wpyiFrTmXU/view?usp=sharing), before I had clarified all the specifics of what information might be available. In that letter, she explained the two distinct databases and the different ways in which they are stored: Db2 for the registrant database and Excel for the complaints. 

According to the letter, both databases need redaction by hand, but the complaints spreadsheet would be easier to produce than the Db2.

After this, I spoke with her again to gain a deeper understanding of the databases involved. Things became more complicated at this point, as I tried to get her to tell me exactly what fields exist in the database and she, instead of disclosing any further information, tried to get me to narrow my request by purpose. I sent an [official MPIA request letter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UdZLxK5KcFDdTCSJmQFs7qp11zp43kiW/view) on Oct. 19, and she sent a [second official response letter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VpUS3x0EJuGJ73soNevig1iqRktWptD8/view) on Oct. 31, by far the longest gap in the agency's responsiveness.

Despite multiple attempts to clarify her position and mine, it is still unclear to me whether the director does not know this database-layout information, does not wish to disclose it or believes any further clarification may be against the law. However, I believe the substantive trouble is primarily an issue of uncertainty as to what the database can produce. 

The director said the way the OCO normally handles requests for information from this database is to produce electronic reports, redacting information manually as needed — a time-consuming process she estimates in her second letter will take 20-30 hours at $33 per hour over the course of 30-45 days. I am asking for a dump of the database itself, with any problematic fields redacted entirely, in hopes this method will be both less burdensome to the OCO and more useful to me. (Unfortunately, I have not been able to determine what fields those might be, as explained above.) 

In our last communication, she said she is waiting for her IT department to respond to the feasibility of this request. She also brought her counsel to the call, who tried again to get me to disclose my purpose for requesting the information so they can decide how best to comply. I explained again that my need is for exploratory research and as such I cannot be more specific, and the general impression he put forth was that this was an unnecessarily burdensome request that was difficult to comply with.

As for the complaints spreadsheet, she is much more willing to disclose this data, apparently because doing so is an easier task than the larger, more complex registrant database. According to the letter, the process of redacting unspecified "information that is not subject to disclosure" will take more than 10 days and may take more than the two hours of free labor — informally estimated by phone to be up to two hours additional time at $33 per hour.

## Next steps

I intend to see this process through whether or not I can complete it before semester's end, although I am pushing to have it resolved before the final day of class.

The complaints database is basically secure, except for securing funding from CNS to pay possible fees. I believe this database is worth exploring, especially in light of the 2016 spike in complaints reported by News-4. I would also like to look into the issue of historically black cemeteries mentioned above.

As for the registrants database, I am waiting to hear back from the director whether the IT department can produce a database dump. If it can, my next steps will depend on the cost of doing so. If it cannot, the only question becomes whether the database information is worth paying the estimated fees, which could be as much as $990. My recommendation is that CNS wait to see the complaints database before purchasing the registrant database. In fact, I believe a web scraper deployed [here](https://www.dllr.state.md.us/CemeteryOversight/web/content/SearchAdvanced.aspx) might enable CNS to acquire the information in the database without going through the OCO.

## Lessons learned

* Clarify in any preliminary written correspondence that such communications are fact-finding only and should not be treated as official MPIA request letters. Otherwise, the request may be elevated to MPIA status before it has been completely defined.

* Never assume that a friendly, helpful contact will lead to an easy acquisition process. First, friendliness does not equate to openness. Second, even well-meaning officials may not always know exactly how to comply with technical requests. Third, small agencies in particular have limited time and resources and therefore have a vested interest in complying with requests as simply as possible.

* In order to secure a fee waiver and to smooth communication, it may be helpful to determine a broad but clearly defined purpose for the information request beyond simply exploratory fact-finding, even if that purpose may evolve over time. However, if this stated purpose is too narrow, it will clearly limit the data produced and may obscure important information.

* To get a fee waiver, be as specific as possible about why disclosure of the information will be in the public interest, otherwise, it is easy to dismiss.

* As for what I learned about myself, I am pleased to say I was able to stand my ground more firmly, with more aplomb and with less mental anguish than I perhaps expected, especially when unexpectedly confronted by the agency's legal counsel.
